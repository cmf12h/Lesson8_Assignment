What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A CDN  is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet and is also an alterniative to hosting JQuery yourself.
1. you do not have to host it yourself, which saves loading time
2. You won't have the same capacity or scalability offered by major CDNs creating less packet loss & faster load times
3. CDNs provide localized data centers which are closer to users, having faster loading times
4. People already visted websites where they automatically download JQuery, causing it to load faster since you are not hosting.
